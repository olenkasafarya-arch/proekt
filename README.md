# Signal Processor for Random Process Analysis

Code for the scientific article: **"Determining the Characteristics of a Random Process by Comparing with Values ​​Based on Distribution Models"**

## 📖 About the Project

This code implements methods for analyzing random processes and comparing their characteristics with model distributions. The project includes:

- Generation of observed signals with various distribution laws
- Generation of model signals for comparison
- Statistical analysis of random process characteristics
- Visualization of analysis results

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Generation of signals** with normal, logistic, Laplace, and gamma distributions
- **Statistical analysis** - calculation of mean, standard deviation, and variance
- **Generation of ordered frequency sequences of model signals
- **Comparative analysis** of random process characteristics
- **Visualization of results** in the form of graphs and charts

## 🛠 Technical Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8+
- **Libraries**:
- `numpy >= 1.21.0`
- `matplotlib >= 3.5.0`
- `scipy >= 1.7.0`
